# Example Project

## Introduction

This is an example project used to teach people how to use the EPD and how to develop new plugins
for it.To use it, just add this plugin <group + artifact + version> to a Product (Product.xml) and 
start your it.

## Description

The ExampleProject provides a View, Map Layer, Map Tools and SettingsPages. The View is currently 
empty and serves only as a Hello World example. Similarly, the SettingsPage is a set of widgets 
that are included by default in the EPD and simplify the management of data (e.g. undo). The Map 
Layer is used to draw a position. In order to see it, the layer must be activated using the layer 
view of the Map Plugin. An ExampleTool is also registered in the map toolbar. As soon as this is 
active, the coordinate can be moved by mouse drag and drop.
